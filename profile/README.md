We are constantly on the hunt for Senior Full Stack OCaml/Rust Engineers to join our development effort on the interview assessment and interviewer platform. If you have the skills for any of the attributes listed below, we'd very much like to hear from you:

- High quality production/hobby experience with OCaml and/or Rust

- Have good experience or familiar with OCaml Dream framework
- High quality production/hobby experience with ReasonML and Melange related toolings

Your good understanding of various topics in static analysis would be looked upon favourably, also it would be ideal if you have good experience with LLM training and fine tuning process, as these form the basis of our coding assessment and scoring system. Ideally you would be based in Australia but we also facilitate remote work arrangement for candidates with the right skillset.
